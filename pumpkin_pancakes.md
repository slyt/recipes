# Pumpkin Pancakes

## Ingredients

### Pumpkin Spice Mix

Makes ~3 Tbsp

| Spice           | Amount |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Ground cinnamon | 2 Tbsp |
| Ground ginger   | 2 tsp  |
| Ground nutmeg   | 2 tsp  |
| Ground allspice | 1 tsp  |
| Ground cloves   | 1 tsp  |

Whisk together and store in an airtight jar.

### Dry bowl

- 1 cup all-purpose flour (replace 1/4 cup of flour with protein powder if desired)
- 2 Tbsp sugar (brown sugar gives deeper flavor)
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1–1.5 tsp of pumpkin spice mix (adjust to taste)

### Wet bowl
- 3/4 cup milk (dairy or oat milk works great)
- 1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree (not pie filling)
- 1 large egg
- 1 Tbsp melted butter or oil (plus more for cooking)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Mix dry ingredients in one bowl (flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, pumpkin spice).
1. Whisk wet ingredients in another bowl (milk, pumpkin, egg, melted butter, vanilla).
1. Pour wet into dry and stir until just combined. _Do not overmix_, a few small lumps are fine and desired.
1. Let batter rest 5 minutes (helps fluffiness).
1. Heat a lightly buttered or oiled skillet over medium heat.
1. Scoop about 1/4 cup batter per pancake. Cook until bubbles form and edges look set, flip, and cook 1–2 more minutes.
1. Serve warm with butter, maple syrup, chopped pecans, whipped cream, or even a dusting of the pumpkin spice blend.

For extra fluffy pancakes, separate egg, beat egg white, and fold in last.
