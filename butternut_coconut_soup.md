# Directions
1. **Sauté Aromatics**  
   Heat oil in a large stainless pot (4–5 gal) over medium-high heat.  
   Add onions, garlic, and ginger; cook 5 minutes until fragrant and golden.

2. **Add Vegetables**  
   Stir in squash and carrots. Cook another 5–7 minutes to lightly caramelize.

3. **Simmer**  
   Pour in broth, salt, pepper, and curry powder.  
   Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer 25–30 minutes, until squash is fork-tender.

4. **Blend**  
   Use an immersion blender (or blend in batches) until silky smooth.

5. **Add Coconut Milk**  
   Stir in both cans of coconut milk.  
   If using lentils or tofu, blend them in now for extra creaminess and protein.  
   Simmer gently for 5 minutes — do not boil.

6. **Brighten & Adjust**  
   Stir in lime juice and adjust seasoning to taste.

7. **Serve or Store**  
   Cool before portioning into freezer-safe containers (1–2 cup portions work best).  
   Label with date and freeze flat if using bags.
